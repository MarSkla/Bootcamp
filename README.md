# Bootcamp

This repository is to store all programming excercises and projects created personally by me as requested by Data Science Bootcamp rules organised by Future Collars.

All files included, were originally created during the course (starting from Dec'20 and ending in Apr'21) and stored on FC's private GitLab installed on corporate server.
After the bootcamp, they were transferred to GitHub.

Initially, all excercises were divided into single repositories, which names referred to bootcamp section and learning progress.
In result, structure grew to ten repositories and my GitHub lost clarity.
This is why I decided to move all files/projects to single repo with subfolders.

I promised myself to try rewrite them when I get more advanced knowledge. Thus some files (maybe even all of them, in future) may be created after Apr'21.
