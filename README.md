# Bootcamp

This repository is to store all programming exercises and projects created personally by me as requested by Data Science Bootcamp rules. Bootcamp organised by Future Collars.

All files included, were originally created during the course (starting from Dec'20 and ending in Apr'21) and stored on FC's private GitLab installed on corporate server.
After the bootcamp, they were transferred to GitHub.

Initially, all exercises were divided into single repositories, which names referred to bootcamp section and learning progress.
In result, structure grew to many repositories and my GitHub lost clarity.
This is why I decided to move all files/projects to single repo with subfolders.

I promised myself to try and rewrite them to more advanced code when I get more knowledge. Thus, some files (maybe even all of them, in future) may be created after Apr'21.

Probably every file could be expanded to meet specific objectives of real life task which I am not able to predict at the time of coding.
